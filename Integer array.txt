//Create an integer array and store ten integers in it. Create a new integer array of the same
//size (10). But do not store any integers in it when you create the second array. Instead,
//assign the first array as the value of the second array.
//For example:
//first array = 12,45,67,...... (total of ten such integers)
//second array = first array
//Print all the elements of the first array using a for-loop.
//Now, change the 3rd element of the first array. Then, print out all the elements of the
//second array. What do you see happen? Explain the reason behind your results.

//When I change the third element of the first array and print out all the elements of the second array,
// the second array prints out the array as same as the first one because we assigned the value of first array to 
//the 2nd one. Thus, the second array behaves like a copy of the first array.
